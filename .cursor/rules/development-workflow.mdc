# Development Workflow Standards

## Pre-Commit Testing
- Run `deno task test:deno` before committing changes
- Ensure all tests pass before requesting code reviews
- Use package-specific tasks during active development for faster feedback

## Error Handling Protocol
- If tests fail, investigate and fix issues before proceeding
- Check both test logic and implementation code
- Use `deno task check` to identify type-related issues
- Use formatting and linting to catch style issues

## Multi-Runtime Considerations
- For significant changes, consider running the full test suite: `deno task test`
- This includes Deno, Node.js, browser, Cloudflare Workers, and Bun testing
- For quick iterations, focus on Deno tests: `deno task test:deno`

## Test Execution Features
- Tests run with `--fail-fast` flag for quick feedback
- Tests run with `--parallel` flag for faster execution
- Tests include documentation tests (`--doc`) to verify code examples
